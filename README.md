<h1 class="gap">Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Stacks are based on the LIFO principle, i.e., the element inserted at the last, is the first element to come out of the list. Queues are based on the FIFO principle, i.e., the element inserted at the first, is the first element to come out of the list. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files. </p>
